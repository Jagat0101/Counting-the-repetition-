# Counting-the-repetition-
This is a java code which returns the number of time the single digit has occured in an number entered by the user 
This program is created by using simple arithmetic logic, this can also be done by using arrays as well
For example if the user enters a number 1232732 and wants to know how many times the number "2" is repeating he can know this by this code 
Try this out soon will upload the same program by using arrays.
